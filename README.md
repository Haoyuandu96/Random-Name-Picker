# Random Name Picker (with Clear Remaining)

Adds a **Clear Remaining** button that instantly removes everyone currently in the *Remaining* pool (does not modify your original input).

## Use
- Import your `randomizer_state.json` (or paste names and click **Use This List**).
- Click **🗑️ Clear Remaining** to empty the Remaining list in one step.
- Undo/Reset still work as before.
