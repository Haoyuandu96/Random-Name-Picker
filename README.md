# Random Name Picker

A minimal single-file web app that lets you paste a list of names, draw a random name, and automatically remove it from the remaining pool. Includes Undo, Draw All, and Export/Import. Works offline (no server) and is perfect for GitHub Pages.

## Quick Start
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `random-name-picker`).
2. Upload **index.html** from this folder (or drop the whole ZIP).
3. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages** and set Source to **Deploy from a branch** with your `main` branch and root (`/`).  
4. Open the Pages URL.

## Local Use
Just open `index.html` in any browser.
